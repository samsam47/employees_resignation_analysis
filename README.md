# In this project, we'll play the role of a data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
